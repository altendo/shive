{"name":"Shive","tagline":"Bash framework for organizing HIVE projects with easy logging and mailing.","body":"Shive: Shell HIVE framework\r\n======\r\n\r\nShive is a Hadoop/HIVE library framework built on [Bashinator](http://www.bashinator.org/) to bring organization, standardized logging, mailing and stack tracing to HIVE projects.  The goal of shive is to write light-weight HIVE jobs with as little boilerplate as possible.  Currently, shive includes utility functions to query HIVE and MySQL.  See examples directory to use shive in a project.\r\n\r\nShive *must* be executed with BASH.  To initialize and run a shive script, be sure to chmod and execute:\r\n\r\n    chmod +x project/bin/script.sh\r\n    ./project/bin/script.sh\r\n\r\nConventions\r\n-----\r\nShive naming conventions are based on [Bashinator](http://www.bashinator.org/docs/bashinator-20090610.pdf) conventions.\r\n\r\n* Functions are named in lowerCamelCase\r\n* Global variables are named in UpperCamelCase\r\n* Local variables are named in lowerCamelCase\r\n* Bashinator functions and global variables begin with a double underscore\r\n* Functions that print their results to stdout are named “printSomething”\r\n* Return codes of functions and exit codes of scripts based on Bashinator:\r\n    * 0, positive check result (for check functions only) or successful task, completion (for all other functions)\r\n    * 1, negative check result (for check functions only, undefined for others)\r\n    * 2, error (for any function)\r\n* Variables are always initialized (with type where possible) before use\r\n* Functions shouldn't ever terminate the script execution on their own, instead, they should return with an error return code so the calling function can take appropriate action.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n-----\r\n* [Bashinator documentation](http://www.bashinator.org/docs/bashinator-20090610.pdf) for style guide \r\n* [HIVE variable substitution](http://hive.apache.org/docs/r0.9.0/language_manual/var_substitution.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
