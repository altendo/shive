        <h1>Shive: Shell HIVE framework</h1>

<p>Shive is a Hadoop/HIVE library framework built on <a href="http://www.bashinator.org/">Bashinator</a> to bring organization, standardized logging, mailing and stack tracing to HIVE projects.  The goal of shive is to write light-weight HIVE jobs with as little boilerplate as possible.  Currently, shive includes utility functions to query HIVE and MySQL.  See examples directory to use shive in a project.</p>

<p>Shive <em>must</em> be executed with BASH.  To initialize and run a shive script, be sure to chmod and execute:</p>

<pre><code>chmod +x project/bin/script.sh
./project/bin/script.sh
</code></pre>

<h2>Conventions</h2>

<p>Shive naming conventions are based on <a href="http://www.bashinator.org/docs/bashinator-20090610.pdf">Bashinator</a> conventions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Functions are named in lowerCamelCase</li>
<li>Global variables are named in UpperCamelCase</li>
<li>Local variables are named in lowerCamelCase</li>
<li>Bashinator functions and global variables begin with a double underscore</li>
<li>Functions that print their results to stdout are named “printSomething”</li>
<li>Return codes of functions and exit codes of scripts based on Bashinator:

<ul>
<li>0, positive check result (for check functions only) or successful task, completion (for all other functions)</li>
<li>1, negative check result (for check functions only, undefined for others)</li>
<li>2, error (for any function)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Variables are always initialized (with type where possible) before use</li>
<li>Functions shouldn't ever terminate the script execution on their own, instead, they should return with an error return code so the calling function can take appropriate action.</li>
</ul><h2>References</h2>
